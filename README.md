## Problem Statement

Students willing to apply for formal projects face numerous challenges in the current system:

1. **Communication Hurdles**: Students need to email teachers individually to request projects, leading to inefficiency and time consumption.
2. **Lack of Response**: Students may or may not receive replies to their project requests, causing uncertainty.
3. **Limited Information**: Students are unaware of teachers with available project slots, limiting their options.
4. **Teacherâ€™s Work Overload**: Teachers receive a flood of emails, making it difficult to assess student qualifications and manage project requests effectively.
5. **Information Gap**: Students lack crucial details like teacher room numbers and availability timings, complicating in-person meetings.

## Solution Overview

To address these challenges, we propose the development of "Project Bridge," an application system designed to automate and streamline the process of applying for project-type courses. The aim is to provide a more efficient and transparent experience for both students and professors.


## Tech Stack

`MERN`, `FIREBASE`

1. Database: `MongoDB`
2. Backend: `Express.js`, `Node.js`
3. Frontend: `React.js`
4. Login: `Google Auth(Firebase)`
5. File Storage: `Google Cloud Storage`
 
 
## Web Application Functionalities

The web application supports three types of users: Professor, Student, and Admin.

<summary>Professor Side Functionalities</summary>
<pre>
1. **Login**: Professors log in using their BITS Google account.
2. **Home Page**: Professors can create new projects (name, description, number of slots, project type, pre-requisites). They can edit or delete projects, with changes reflected instantly on the webpage.

3. **Requests Page**: Professors can view all student requests for their projects in a tabular format. Information includes CG eligibility, degree, resume, performance sheet, pre-requisites fulfilled, and a short paragraph written by the student. Professors can accept or reject requests and undo decisions if necessary.
     

5. **Profile Page**: Professors can fill out their basic details, such as name, department, room number, and block/building.

</details>


<details>
<summary>Admin Functionalities</summary>
<pre>
Admins can view various statistics related to projects and requests, such as projects per department, average requests per department, project slots with respect to departments, and project type distribution, displayed in graphs (line, bar, pie chart, etc.).
